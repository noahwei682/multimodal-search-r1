**MMSearch-R1** is an end-to-end RL framework that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search with real-world multimodal search tools.

## Multimodal Search Tool Implemention
We draw inspiration from open-sourced implementation [OpenDeepResearcher](https://github.com/mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher/blob/main/open_deep_researcher.ipynb), which integrates [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/), [JINA Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/), and LLM-based summarization to retrieve and condense web content relevant to a given question. Currently, MMSearch-R1 includes two types of search tools: an image search tool and a text search tool.
- **Image Search Tool:** This tool is built solely on SerpAPI. The model provides the image (via URL or other form) to the tool, which is responsible for retrieving the top-k visually relevant web pages. The tool returns a sequence of interleaved thumbnails and titles extracted from those pages.
- **Text Search Tool:** This tool combines SerpAPI, JINA Reader, and Qwen3-32B for summarization. The model submits a text query, and SerpAPI retrieves the top-k relevant web page URLs. JINA Reader parses and cleans the content of those pages, and Qwen3-32B generates summaries based on the original query. The tool ultimately returns a list of summarized passages from the top-k relevant webpages with their respective links.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Before initiating formal training, you are expected to build your own search tool pipeline under the `mmsearch_r1/utils/tools/` directory and invoke it appropriately during the multi-turn rollout process.

## Data Construction
Both the training and validation datasets follow the format defined by veRL. We provide an example dataset under directory `mmsearch_r1/data` as a reference to help you prepare your own training data.

## Train & Eval
We recommend use the command below for unified training and evaluation:
```bash
bash mmsearch_r1/scripts/run_mmsearch_r1_grpo.sh
```
We highlight the important configurations for training the Multi-Round Search LMMs:
- `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.name`: should be `vllm_multiturn_mmsearch` for multi-turn search rollout;
- `actor_rollout_ref.actor.use_multi_turn_response_mask`: should be `True`, as we use it to refine the original `response_mask` for accurate loss calculation.
- `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.max_gen_round`: The max number of turns during rollout;
- `data.max_response_length`: The max response length for each turn;
- `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.response_length_total`: The max conversation length for all turns (except the user prompt in the first turn);

For evaluation only, configure these parameters in the above script:
```bash
...
trainer.val_files=${path_to_val_data} \
trainer.val_only=True \
trainer.val_only_save_dir=${path_to_save_dir} \
trainer.val_generations_to_log_to_wandb=64 # num of val generations to log, this should be larger than the size of val dataset for complete saving
```
The model's responses will be saved in JSON format under `${path_to_save_dir}`, which can be used for subsequent analysis and evaluation.
